# Excercise 8: Use tracking and traceability analytics

SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation offers multiple options to cover diverse monitoring and reporting needs of different roles and team members. The integrated analytics functionality arches over project management, task management, process management, change and deploy management and test management applications. Each application sends change events to the Analytical framework which processes those events and turns into meaningful information and insights in form of dashboards and reports.

## Excercise 8.1: Use Project Overview Dashboard

The overview page provides a high-level overview of progress in different areas. It acts like a health check monitor for project and at the same time it provides connectivity to other applications for a faster drill down. Each card on overview page represent a specific topic and displays set of relevant information.
