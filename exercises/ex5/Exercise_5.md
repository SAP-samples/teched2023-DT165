## Exercise 5.2 Manage Defects

The defect is picked up and assigned to a team, role, or processor. In the Additional Information section. 


The processor is notified about their defect assignment, then analyses and corrects the Defect.               
Once the Defect has been corrected, the processor changes the Defect status to Retest required and assigns it to the original reporter. 

1. Once the Defect is corrected, change the status to **retest required**
