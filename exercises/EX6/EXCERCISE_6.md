1. Provide a **name** for the Defect.
2. Enter **description**.
3. **Save** Defect.

## Exercise 6.2 Manage Defects 

In the Defects app, you can create and manage defects for deficiencies that were discovered during testing or in the application. 

If a test run fails due to an application issue or if a deficiency is discovered during regular application usage, you can use the Defects app to make sure that the defect is addressed and processed.

1. Go back to the **Test execution app**. 
2. Ensure you have chosen the right Test Case execution. 
3. Click on the defect number to open the created Defect. 
4. Open the Defect by clicking on **Defect Overview**.

The defect is picked up and assigned to a team, role, or processor. In the Additional Information section. 

The processor is notified about their defect assignment, then analyses and corrects the Defect.               
Once the Defect has been corrected, the processor changes the Defect status to Retest required and assigns it to the original reporter.
