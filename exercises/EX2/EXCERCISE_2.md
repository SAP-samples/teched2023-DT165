# Exercise 2 - Manage and Execute Tasks

The purpose of this exercise is to manage and execute tasks of the project.

## Exercise 2.1 Project Overview
The overview page provides a high-level overview of progress in different areas. It acts like a health check monitor for projects, and at the same time, it provides connectivity to other applications for a faster drill-down. Each card on the overview page represents a specific topic and displays set of relevant KPIs.
